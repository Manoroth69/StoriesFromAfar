Backstory — The Legend of Symbiothec
Symbiothec was not born but forged—a child of a fractured world where technology and nature collided violently. Raised in the forsaken ruins of New Gaia, a city swallowed by time and tangled roots, he was a survivor from the start. As a boy, he struggled against the harsh wilderness and ruthless scavengers who sought to exploit what remained.

His early life was marked by brutal challenges: starvation, betrayal, and the crushing loneliness of being caught between two worlds. But instead of succumbing, he learned to listen—to the rustling of leaves, the faint hum of circuits in the ruins, even the whispers carried by the snow. His senses sharpened, evolving beyond human limits, and slowly, his body adapted, densifying muscle and bone to survive the brutal terrain.

As he grew, so did his powers. Symbiothec became a master of senses, able to detect the faintest heartbeat from afar, to read the shadows hiding an enemy’s weakness, and to anticipate threats before they manifested. His intuition became an almost psychic sixth sense, warning him of danger up to a kilometer away.

But his greatest strength lies in his ability to merge with his environment. He is a living symbiosis of flesh, metal, and nature’s will—his mind and body an organic network that pulses with the life force around him. He can scan, map, and manipulate the world with technological grace, moving through the ruins and wilderness as both predator and protector.

His enemies tremble not just at his physical power—lifting cars like toys—but at his uncanny psychological prowess. Symbiothec can infiltrate the minds and anatomies of those who oppose him, unraveling their defenses from within, turning their own fears and weaknesses against them.

At 30, he is a legend whispered about in the shadows—part man, part machine, part myth. A guardian of balance in a world teetering on the edge of collapse, forever entwined with the environment he calls home.
